â€‹I completed this challenge using Javascript and Jest.  I approached the problem in a test driven approach, creating the unit test first and then adding in the logic.  I did not address all portions of the challenge as of this posting.  I am currently, sending correctly formatted JSON.  For this challenge to be 100% accurately meeting the requirements, I would need to handle errors for incorrectly formatted JSON.

To get my program running using the jest test runner. Run the following commands:
- `yarn install`
- run `yarn test`

You should see that the test is passing.  

Is there a better way to solve the problem? Most defintiely! Thanks for the opportunity!
