â€‹I completed this challenge using Javascript and Jest.  I approached the problem in a test driven approach, creating the unit test first and then adding in the logic.  I did not address all portions of the challenge as of this posting.  I am currently sending correctly formatted JSON.  For this challenge to be accurately meeting the requirements, I would need to handle errors for incorrectly formatted JSON.

To get my program running run the following commands:
- `yarn install`
- run `yarn test`

You should see that the tests are passing.  

Thanks for the opportunity!
